# Awesome Note Taker

## Description

I've made other note takers before, but I wanted to make one with a real way of storing the data. This application uses a local database through a json file. I like being able to leave the page and not worry about my notes disappearing. I learned a lot about how databases work and I'm looking forward to seeing more.

## Usage

This application has very straight forward usage. You will first be greeted by the home page. All you need to do is click 'get started' to go to the notes page. From there, enter a note title and note text, a save icon will appear in the top right. Once you click that, your notes will apear in a column on the left that you can click and refer to at any time. Also, if you're done with a note, click the trash can icon next to it and it will be deleted.
